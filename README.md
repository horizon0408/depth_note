## Stereo depth estimation<a name="stereo"></a>

<a href = "https://github.com/JiaRenChang/PSMNet">PSMNet: Pyramid Stereo Matching Network(CVPR 2018)</a>
* Spatial Pyramid Pooling(SPP) Module
    + aims to incorporate context information by learning the relationship between an object and its sub-region.
* 4D cost volume
    + concat left and right SPP feature maps across each disparity level (H, W, D, feature_size)
* Stacked hour-glass architecture for cost volume regularization
    + repeat top-down/bottom-up processing with intermediate supervision
    
 <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04025.pdf">GwcNet: Group-wise Correlation Stereo Network(CVPR 2019)</a>
 * Construct cost volume by group-wise correlation
    + full correlation(DispNetC) lose information because only produces a single-channel correlation map for each disparity level
    + Divide channel into multiple groups, split features along channel dimension
    + left ith left group is cross-correlated with ith right group over all disparity levels(compute inner product as DispNetC)
    + packed correlations into matching cost volume (D/4, H/4, W/4, N_g)

* Modified the stacked 3D hourglass networks 
    + add extra output module and the extra loss lead to better features at lower layers
    + remove residual connection between output modules.
    + connections within each hourglass are added 1 * 1 * 1 3D conv
